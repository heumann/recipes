1 1/2 cup sugar
2/3 cup margarine (+1/8)
1/4 cup water

2 cups (+1/2 cup) of chocolate chips (12oz)
2 tsp vanilla

4 eggs

1 1/4 cup flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking soda

Combine sugar, margarine and water in a small saucepan and bring just to a boil.

Remove from the heat and add chocolate chips and vanilla; stir until chocolate melts.

Transfer chocolate mixture to a bowl.  Beat in eggs, one at a time.

Sift together flour, salt and baking soda.  Gradually add flour mixture to chocolate.

Blend in 1 cup of nuts (optional).

Spread into a greased 9"x13" pan, and bake at 325F for 50 minutes.

Let cool, and sift powdered sugar on top.
