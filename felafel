INGREDIENTS
	•	1 1/4 cups dried chickpeas (7 oz)
	•	3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
	•	3/4 cup finely chopped onion (about half a whole onion)
	•	1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
	•	1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
	•	2 teaspoon kosher salt
	•	1 tablespoon ground cumin
	•	1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
	•	1/2 teaspoon black pepper
	•	1/2 teaspoon baking soda
	•	1/4 teaspoon cayenne
	•	About 6 cups vegetable oil (48 fl oz)
	•	Special equipment: a deep-fat thermometer

PREPARATION

Soak chickpeas in cold water to cover by 2 inches in a bowl at room temperature at for 12-24 hours. Drain well in a colander.

Purée chickpeas with all remaining ingredients except oil in a food processor until as smooth as possible, about 2 minutes. Spread purée in a 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking pan and let dry, uncovered, 1 hour.

Scoop a large spoonful of purée into your hand and gently ball the mixture between the palms of your hands and place onto a long sheet of wax paper (or silicon matt if baking), press each ball into a patty shape, roughly 2 inches. (Pressing the purée will help the patty hold together when frying.) Make a small hole in center of patty with tip of your pinkie finger (to help cook evenly). Make more patties in same manner, arranging them in 1 layer.

If your patties are still a little too wet, you can par-bake the felafel in a 350 degree oven for ~10 minutes before frying.

Heat about 1 inch oil in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot (preferably cast-iron) until thermometer registers 340°F. Working in batches of 4, gently drop patties into hot oil, then fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, and transfer to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 340°F between batches. Serve falafel warm or at room temperature.
