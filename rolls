Rolls (Thanksgiving)
Judy Heumann

1/4-1/3 cup sugar
1 tbsp yeast
1 1/4 cup milk (can scald milk)
1/4-3/4 cup melted butter, cooled
2 1/2 tsp salt
2 eggs
4 1/2-5 cups flour

Mix yeast, 1/2 cup warm water, a couple pinches of sugar and let rise in a warm place.

Put into a bowl with cooled butter, milk, sugar, eggs and salt.

Add flour to form a sticky but manageable dough (you can use a food processor).

Put into a greased bowl covered with a towel, and let rise until doubled in bulk in a warm place.

Pinch off small amounts and place either in greased muffin tins, or on a greased baking sheet.

Optional: glaze with beaten egg and poppy seeds.  Bake 20-25 minutes, until browned.
