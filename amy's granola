The basic recipe recipe is from Good Eats, but I have greatly augmented it by adding lots more fruits, nuts and seeds to the granola recipe.

Ingredients:

3 cups rolled oats
1 cup almonds (can use untoasted)
1 cup sesame seeds
1 cup pumpkin seeds
1 cup sunflower seeds
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons maple syrup
1/4 cup vegetable oil
(1/4 cup raspberry syrup if youâ€™ve got some)
1 large spoonful of honey
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup raisins
1 cup dried cranberries
1 cup cubed dried figs
1 cup cubed dried dates

Directions:

- Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.
- In a large bowl, combine the oats, nuts, seeds, cinnamon and brown sugar.
- In a small pan, heat on low syrups, honey, oil, and salt until salt is dissolved.
- Stir oil mixture in to oats mixture, then pour onto 2 sheet pans.
- Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to achieve an even color.
- Remove from oven and transfer into a large bowl. Add fruits and mix until evenly distributed.
