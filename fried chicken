Fried Chicken
via Judy Heumann

1 chicken
half quart buttermilk

Pour buttermilk over chicken and soak all day (or overnight) covered.
Shake off buttermilk, don't rinse.

Into a sturdy plastic bag put:
1 c flour
1 tsp curry powder (or cumin)
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper

Shake the bag to mix, put the chicken in and shake to coat (only put a few pieces in at a time), then place chicken on a plate.

In a large fry pan heat vegetable oil 1/8in deep at high heat.
When oil sizzles use a pair of tongs to put the chicken in the oil.  Turn down the heat a little at this point.
When the first side is golden brown turn over and brown the other side.  Turn down the heat a bit more.
Rotate pieces every 5 minutes for 30-35 minutes or until done.
