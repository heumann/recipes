INGREDIENTS

3 cups grated fresh zucchini
2/3 cup melted unsalted butter
1 1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup dutch cocoa powder
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 teaspoons baking soda
Pinch salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 bag choc. chips (11-12oz)

METHOD

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Coat each muffin cup in your muffin pan with a little butter

In a large bowl combine the sugar, eggs, cocoa powder and vanilla.

Stir in the grated zucchini and then the melted butter.

In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, and cinnamon then stir the dry ingredients into the zucchini mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips.

Use a spoon to distribute the muffin dough equally among the cups, filling the cups up completely.

Bake on the middle rack until muffins are golden brown, and the top of the muffins bounce back when you press on them, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Toothpick test the center of the muffins. If toothpick comes clean set on wire rack to cool for 5 minutes. Remove muffins from the tin, let cool another 20 minutes.
