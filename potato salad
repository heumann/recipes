via New Seasons

2 1/2 lbs potatoes, cut into large pieces (Yukon Gold recommended)
3/4 cup mayo
1/4 cup dill pickle juice
1 tbsp dijon mustard
1 tbsp yellow mustard
1 tsp salt
3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 stalks celery, diced
6 green onions, thinly sliced
3 hard boiled eggs, chopped (up to 6 work)
5 small dill pickles, chopped
6 tbsp chopped parsley (more works)

Boil potatoes in salted water until tender, about 15 minutes.  Allow to cool.

In a small bowl, combine/whisk mayo, pickle juice, mustards, and salt.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine potato chunks, vinegar, celery, green onions, pickles, and parsley.  Stir to combine.

Add mayo mixture and stir thoroughly again.  Cover and chill for 4-6 hours or overnight.
