Kansas City Barbecue Sauce Recipe

Prep time: 5 minutesCook time: 35 minutes
This makes enough sauce for 10-20 chicken legs or thighs, 4 racks of ribs or a regular pork shoulder.

INGREDIENTS

2 cups tomato sauce
1/2 cup apple juice (i used diluted molasses)
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup brown sugar
5 Tbsp butter
3 Tbsp paprika
2 Tbsp chili powder
1 Tbsp chipotle powder (optional)
4 finely chopped garlic cloves
1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
Salt to taste (try using smokey salt)
Cayenne to taste

METHOD

1 Heat the butter in a pot over medium heat for 2-3 minutes. Add the onion and sauté until it begins to brown. Add the garlic and sauté for another 2 minutes.

2 Pour in the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine. Simmer slowly for at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 hours. Adjust the heat and salt levels with the cayenne and salt right before you plan to use this sauce, which is great on ribs, chicken and pork shoulder.

Yield: Makes about 2 1/2 cups.
