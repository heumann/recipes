Combine orange juice, water, honey, vanilla, syrup, and cinnamon powder in a saucepan on medium heat for a few minutes.

Put dry oats, nuts, wheat germ and seeds in a large bowl and pour liquid mixture over top and stir until mixture is well coated.

Lay wet oats down on a large baking tray or pyrex dish (try to do a layer) and pop in the oven.  Bake for 30-45 minutes or until oats start turning brown, stirring mixture occassionally.
