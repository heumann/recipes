New York Pizza Dough
via http://feelingfoodish.com/the-best-new-york-style-pizza-dough/

398 grams of flour, all purpose or bread
1 1/8 cups water, cool to room temp
1/2 tsp instant dry yeast
1.25 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tbsp olive oil

Place water in mixing bowl.

In a separate bowl, mix salt and yeast (and sugar if using) into flour.

Combine flour/salt/yeast mixture into water and mix until all the flour has been incorporated.

After flour has been totally incorporated, add oil and knead for about 4 to 5 minutes (see note)

Test final dough temperature, which should ideally be between high 70s to low 80s (optional)

Divide dough into 2 equal pieces (using a digital scale if possible; each ball should weigh 11.5 oz [~326 grams]) and place in greased, sealed quart-sized container or oiled/greased freezer bag and refrigerate overnight or up to 72 hours.

Within 1 hour or less of baking, remove dough from the fridge and allow the dough to come to room temperature.

In the meantime, place your pizza stone in oven and preheat at 550 degrees (depending on thickness of your stone and your oven's power) for at least 1 hour

Open each dough ball using care not to degas, transfer to a pre-floured pizza peel (or on parchment paper), and top with your favorite sauce, cheese, or other toppings (watch video in the link above).

Transfer pizza from peel to oven or slide parchment paper onto preheated pizza pan/stone and bake for 4 to 6 minutes each until browned on top and cheese has melted but not burned.
