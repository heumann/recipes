Tempeh
via mantid (aka rob)

There is no recipe, but I can tell you conceptually:

I brushed a glass pan with olive oil, then poured in a zigzag of a favorite bbq sauce.  Slice the tempeh into small "rib like" pieces (this totally depends on your end use... you could do a sheet at a time, or grind it into little granules, or...  I just made french-fry like sticks for this dish)

Then I added apple cider vinegar and 1/4 of a beer i just opened to drink.  Mirror Pond Pale Ale.  Slap about 3 or 4 cloves of garlic under blade of knife to remove the skin.  Then cut them into about 4 pieces (small enough to eat if that is what you are into, or avoid if you are not).  Slice up half a good sized leek.  Mix in pan.  I would often add all kinds of this and that at this point, but since the bbq sauce I started with is really good, I didn't.  Just added a little more bbq sauce to the top of it all and mixed it with a spoon. 

It will bake under foil for about 35 mins @ 400.  More bbq sauce added at serving if need be.  It will be served with steamed kale and chard; themselves with a little lemon juice and pepper.  Maybe some peas, too, if I feel like it.
