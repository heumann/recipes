3 cups (381 grams) all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (66 grams) granulated sugar
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 sticks (170 grams) unsalted butter, cold and cubed
1 cup (237 grams) buttermilk
2 large eggs, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Coarse sugar

Adjust the oven rack to the center position and preheat to 400Â°F. Line two baking pans with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda.

Add the butter and cut with a pastry cutter or a fork until the butter is the size of large peas.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, 1 egg, and vanilla extract.

Make a well in the middle and add the liquid mixture. Mix until just combined. Don't over mix. If adding in dried fruit, nuts, chocolate, or other flavorings, do so now.

Transfer the dough to a floured surface. *Optional Step: See Recipe Notes for lamination instructions.

Divide into 2 equal parts. Lightly knead each into 3/4-inch thick, 6-inch diameter rounds. Cut each round into 8 wedges and place on your prepared baking pans. Space them out about 2 inches apart.

At this point the unbaked scones can be refrigerated overnight, or sealed and frozen for up to 1 month. If baking from frozen, add about 2 minutes to the baking time.

In a small bowl, combine the remaining egg with 1 teaspoon water. Brush over the scones. Sprinkle with the coarse sugar.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. The scones are best served warm, or within a few hours of baking.
