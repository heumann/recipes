Wassail

Ingredients:
1 Gallon apple cider
1-2 L cranberry juice
1/2 C honey
1/2 C sugar (could use brown sugar)
2 oranges
Whole cloves
1 apple, peeled and diced
Allspice
Ginger
Nutmeg
3 cinnamon sticks
1/2 C - 1 C brandy (optional)

Set the crockpot to its lower setting, and pour apple cider, cranberry juice,
honey and sugar in, mixing carefully. As it heats up, stir so that the honey
and sugar dissolve. Stud the oranges with the cloves, and place in the pot
(they'll float). Add the diced apple. Add allspice, ginger and nutmeg to taste
-- usually a couple of tablespoons of each is plenty.  Finally, snap the
cinnamon sticks in half and add those as well.

Cover the pot and allow to simmer 2 - 4 hours on low heat. About half an hour
prior to serving, add the brandy if you choose to use it.
