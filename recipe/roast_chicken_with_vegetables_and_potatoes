via https://www.marthastewart.com/1542608/roast-chicken-vegetables-and-potatoes

1 whole chicken (about 4 pounds)
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
Olive oil

Assorted baking veggies, enough to fill the pan around the chicken
  potatoes cubed
  carrots, halved
  onions chopped roughly
  garlic cloves
  brussel sprouts, halved
  mushrooms, whole
  cabbage steaks

Place chicken on a large plate and season generously with salt and pepper; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. 

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Let chicken stand at room temperature 30 minutes. Meanwhile, toss veggies with oil; season with salt and pepper. Arrange in a large roasting pan.

Rub chicken with  oil, tie legs with twine if necessary, and nestle in center. Roast, flipping vegetables around edges once, until chicken is golden and a thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast (avoiding bone) registers 160 degrees, 55 to 60 minutes. Transfer chicken and lemon halves to a carving board and tent loosely with foil. Flip vegetables; return to oven and roast until caramelized and tender, 15 to 20 minutes more. Carve chicken and transfer to a platter or return to roasting pan. Sprinkle with parsley, squeeze lemon over top, and serve with vegetables.

Note:
Salting the chicken overnight ensures evenly seasoned, juicy meat. However if you're pressed for time, you can season the chicken the day of and let stand at room temperature for one hour
