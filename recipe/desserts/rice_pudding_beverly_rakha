Rice Pudding
via Beverly Rakha

6 cups milk
3/4 cup long grain rice (preferably jasmine)
1 cup whipping cream
3/4 cup sugar
3 egg yolks, beaten
2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
~1 tsp cinnamon (or a couple of sticks, basically to taste)
anise seed, to taste (1 star)
cardamom, to taste (1-2 pods)
nutmeg, whole, to taste (1/2 - 1 1/2 pods)

Optional:
3 egg whiles, beaten
more sugar

(Optional: try boiling the rice separately according to normal rice cooking practices, then add fully cooked.)

Rinse medium saucepan in cold water, do not dry.  Pour in milk, add whole spices and bring to a boil over medium heat.

Stir in rice and return to a boil.

Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until rice is tender and pudding is thick (about 55 minutes, ~35 for jasmine).  Stir occasionally.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine cream, sugar, egg yolks, vanilla and salt.  Set aside.

Optional: beat egg whites until foamy.  Slowly add some sugar while beating to form stiff peaks.  Set aside.

When rice is tender, stir in cream mixture until completely combined.  Heat to boil.

Remove from heat [and fold in egg white mixture].

Pour into a two-quart serving dish, chill at least four hours.

Sprinkle with cinnamon.
