Vanilla Custard

750ml whole milk
100g cornstarch (about 1/2 cup) (LESS. IT'S BEEN TOO STIFF AND CORNSTARCHY)
75-100g caster sugar (about 1 cup)
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
2 egg yolks
2 egg whites (optional, not recommended)

1. Put cornstarch, sugar, and vanilla bean paste into a bowl, whisk in 150ml of the milk for a few minutes until well blended.

2. Bring the remaining 600ml milk to a boil. Once boiling, remove from heat and whisk in the cornstarch mix. Move back to heat and let mixture come to a boil again. Let boil for at least a minute or until noticeably thickened, continuing to whisk.

3. Take off heat and whisk the egg yolks into the thickened milk. The mixture will thicken a bit more. Keep on whisking!

4. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold into the custard. (This step optional, and not recommended)

5. Pour into bowl and refrigerate covered for a few hours.

I inadvertently left out the egg whites first time around (got egg white all over the table trying to separate), but still tastes fine. Definitely try it with the egg whites next time.

While transferring the fully cooked custard into a refrigerator container, I noticed that some of the cornstarch/milk mix in the corners of the pot that the whisker can't reach, didn't get mixed in. I got the silicon spatula out and got at those corners, and whisked it back in to the custard but it remained a bit lumpy. Not sure of a solution. Maybe get the silicon spatula out while the custard is still in the boiling/setting process and get at those corners then?
