2 3/4 cups (385 grams) all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup (227 grams) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 1/2 cups (300 grams) granulated white sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Coating:
1/3 cup (66 grams) granulated white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Preparation:
In a large bowl whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder.

In the bowl of your electric mixer (or with a hand mixer), beat the butter and
sugar until smooth (about 2 to 3 minutes). Add the eggs, one at a time, beating
well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the
vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and beat until you have a smooth dough.
If the dough is soft, cover and refrigerate until firm enough to roll into
balls (one to two hours).

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (190 degrees C) and place rack in the center of
the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Shape the dough into 1 inch (2.54 cm) round balls.

Coating: In a large shallow bowl mix together the sugar and cinnamon.

Roll the balls of dough in the cinnamon sugar and place on the prepared pan,
spacing about 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Then, using the bottom of a glass, gently
flatten each cookie to about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) thick.

Bake the cookies for about 8 - 10 minutes, or until they are light golden brown
around the edges. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.

Can store in an airtight container, at room temperature, for about 10 - 14
days.

Makes about 6 dozen cookies.
