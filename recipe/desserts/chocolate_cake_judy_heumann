Chocolate Cake
via Judy Heumann

3/4 cup cocoa
1 1/2 cup boiling water
2 1/2 cups white flour (maybe a bit less)
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
3/8 tsp salt
3/8 tsp baking powder
3/4 cup (150g) margarine
2 cups sugar (but use slightly less--really 1 7/8 cup)
3 eggs
1 1/4 tsp vanilla

(the amounts are in strange quantities because I took the original recipe and
added a half because the original was for cupcakes and I use 3-8" round baking
pans)

Prepare pans--grease and flour. (Put some flour into the greased pan and shake
around until there is a thin film of flour covering the pan.) Preheat oven to
350 degrees.

Blend cocoa and boiling water until smooth.  Cool. (I put it into the refrig or
freezer to cool it down.)  Into a separate bowl, sift flour, baking soda,
baking powder and salt. (I don't sift the flour.)

Beat margarine, sugar, eggs and vanilla with an electric mixer.  Stir in flour
mixture alternately with cooled cocoa mixture.  Beat after each addition until
batter is smooth.  Pour into pans.  Bake about 15 minutes and check--then 20,
if not done.  Test doneness with a toothpick.  Cool in the pans then remove
from the pans when cool.  Frost with a butter cream frosting.


Buttercream frosting

1/2 cup softened margarine
3 cups powdered sugar
3 tablespoons milk
1 tsp. vanilla

Mix together until well blended.

Depending upon how many layers you have, you might need more due frosting
between layers.

A hint: if you freeze the cake layers, well wrapped in plastic right after they
cool, then you can frost them frozen and you will not have trouble with crumbs
mixing in with the frosting.  And, it will taste like fresh baked!  Trust me!
