1 Cup Honey (orange blossom if you can get it)
4  Eggs
1 Tbls Orange Zest
1 1/2 Cup AP Flour

Put honey in a metal bowl, and whisk in eggs all at once, until foamy.  Whisk in zest.

Sift dry ingredients together, and whisk dry mixture in to wet in small amounts.

When the batter is all combined, pour into a well-greased bread pan.

Bake for 30 minutes at 350.  Check for doneness by using a skewer.
