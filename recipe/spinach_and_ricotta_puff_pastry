Spinach and Ricotta Puff Pastry
via https://myfoodmemoirs.com/2022/09/30/spinach-and-ricotta-puff-pastry/

Fresh spinach 130g (Frozen spinach 150g)
Grated Parmigiano Reggiano 90g
Fresh ricotta 225g
Grated mozzarella 60g
Fresh mozzarella 50g (optional)
Salt 1tsp (add as needed)
Freshly grated black pepper as needed (optional)
Pinch of nutmeg
Store-bought rolled puff pastry 320g
1 egg

Note: 30 minutes fridge chill, 30 minutes baking.


Blanch the spinach, drain, and squeeze out as much water as you can, then finely chop it.

Next, mix the ricotta, Parmigiano Reggiano, salt, nutmeg, grated and fresh mozzarella, and black pepper. When that is well combined, add in the spinach, mix, and make sure to taste the filling for seasoning- add more if needed.

Gently roll out your store-bought puff pastry and use a sharp knife to split it into 4 quarters (keep the parchment paper that comes with the puff pastry for easier transfer to the baking tray). Use a spoon and spatula to top the pastry on one half of the quartered pastry (the other half will be used to seal the filling), leaving about 1.5 cm of space on the edge of the pastry to help with the sealing. Repeat the same for all 4 pastries.

Use the spatula to flatten out the filling as much as you can, then cover it with the other half of the pastry, gently pressing on the edges with your thumb. Then follow along with a fork. And finally, use a sharp knife to make incisions across the top of the pastry. Leave them to cool in the fridge for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 200°C /392°F for at least 5 minutes before the puff pastry is done chilling. Then lightly glaze each with an egg wash (1 whisked egg) and bake for 25 minutes. Make sure you rotate the baking tray halfway through. Remove the puff pastries from the oven once they turn a golden color and the bottom is slightly browned.

Serve hot!
