http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/4-pepper-deviled-eggs-recipe/index.html

6 hard boiled eggs, cooled and peeled
1 teaspoon whole pink peppercorns, divided
1/2 teaspoon whole white peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon whole green peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon pickle liquid
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Pinch sugar

Slice the eggs in half from top to bottom. Scoop the yolks into a medium
mixing bowl and lay the whites aside. Place all of the peppercorns, except 1/2
teaspoon of the pink peppercorns, into a spice grinder and process until
ground well. Add the ground peppers, pickle liquid, mayonnaise, mustard, salt
and sugar to the egg yolks and using a fork, stir to thoroughly combine. Place
the mixture into a zip-top plastic bag and cut a small hole at one of the
corners. Pipe the mixture into each of the white halves. Coarsely grind the
remaining 1/2 teaspoon of pink peppercorns and use to garnish the top of each
egg.

Chill for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.
