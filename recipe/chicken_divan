The original recipe uses cream of mushroom soup as a single ingredient and I’ve added a cream of mushroom soup from scratch recipe to be cooked ahead of the Divan recipe.





Cream of mushroom ingredients:



1 tablespoon butter

4-5 mushrooms finely chopped

3 garlic cloves minced

3 1/2 tablespoons flour

1/2 cup chicken broth

1/2 cup milk (2% or whole)



Cream of mushroom instructions:



Whisk half of the broth with flour, salt and pepper in a small bowl, until smooth, set aside.

Melt butter in a large pan over medium heat

Add mushrooms and garlic cooking until mushrooms reduce in size

Stir in the other half of the broth, and milk in with the mushrooms

Gradually pour in the flour/broth mixture and stir

Continually stir until sauce thickens and begins to bubble.  Set aside and let cool
