Surprise Tatin
via "Plenty" (recipe book by Yotam Ottolenghi)

1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes (or the equivalent of sun-dried)
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and black pepper
1 lb new potatoes (skins on)
1 large onion, thinly sliced
3 tbsp sugar
2 tsp butter
3 oregano sprigs
5oz aged goat cheese, sliced
1 puff pastry sheet, rolled thinly

Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for 25 minutes.  Drain and let cool.  Trim off a bit of the top and bottom of each potato, then cut into 1-inch-thick discs.

Saute the onion with the oil and some salt for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown.

Once you've prepared all the vegetables, brush a 9-inch cake pan with oil and line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper.

In a small pan, cook the sugar and butter on a high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, to get a semi-dark caramel.  Pour the caramel carefully into the cake pan and tilt it to spread the caramel evenly over the bottom.  Pick the oregano leaves, tear and scatter on the caramel.

Lay the potato slices close together, cut-side down, on the bottom of the pan.  Gently press onion and tomatoes into the gaps and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.

Spread the slices of goat cheese evenly over the potatoes  Cute a puff pastry disc that is 1 inch larger in diameter than the pan.  Lay the pastry lid over the tart filling and gently tuck the edges down around the potatoes inside the pan.  (At this stage, you can chill the tart for up to 24 hours.)

Preheat the over to 400F.  Bake the tart for 25 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350F and continue baking for 15 minutes, or until the pastry is thoroughly cooked.  Remove from the oven and let settle for 2 minutes only.  Hold an inverted plate firmly on top of the pan and carefully but briskly turn them over together, then lift off the pan.  Serve the tart hot or warm.
