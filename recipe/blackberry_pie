via https://www.joyofbaking.com/BlackberryPie.html

5 cups (2 1/2 pints) (1.2 L) fresh blackberries

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

3 tablespoons (30 grams) cornstarch

3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated white sugar

1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon

optional: 1/8 tsp cardamom

1 tablespoon (14 grams) unsalted butter, cut into small chunks


Place the blackberries in a large bowl and toss with the lemon juice. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon. Gently mix the sugar mixture into the blackberries. Remove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Dot with the tablespoon of butter.

Place the top pie shell on the pie, and sprinkle with a little sugar, if desired. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven.

Place the pie plate on a large baking sheet and bake the pie for about 25-30 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring or pie shield. Continue to bake the pie for another 15-20 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble.

Remove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Reheat before serving.

Makes one 9 inch (23 cm) pie.
