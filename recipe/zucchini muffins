INGREDIENTS

3 cups grated fresh zucchini
2/3 cup melted unsalted butter
1 1/3 cup sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 teaspoons baking soda
Pinch salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 cup walnuts (optional)
1 cup raisins or dried cranberries (optional)
* 1 tbsp grated lemon rind
* 1 tbsp crystallized ginger/ginger-sugar or a little less if using fresh ginger

METHOD

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Coat each muffin cup in your muffin pan with a little butter

In a large bowl combine the sugar, eggs, and vanilla.

Stir in the grated zucchini, ginger, lemon rind and then the melted butter.

In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, nutmeg, and cinnamon then stir these dry ingredients into the zucchini mixture. Stir in walnuts, raisins or cranberries if using.

Use a spoon to distribute the muffin dough equally among the cups, filling the cups up completely.

Bake on the middle rack until muffins are golden brown, and the top of the muffins bounce back when you press on them, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Toothpick test the center of the muffins. If toothpick comes clean set on wire rack to cool for 5 minutes. Remove muffins from the tin, let cool another 20 minutes.

Note, if you are including walnuts and dried fruit, you will likely have more batter than is needed for 12 muffins. I got about 14 muffins from this batch, and that included filling the muffin cups up as far as they could possibly go (above the surface of the muffin tin).
