Creamy Macaroni and Cheese

2 tbsp butter
1 cup cottage cheese (not lowfat)
2 cups milk (not skim)
1 tsp dry mustard
a pinch of cayenne pepper
a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 lb sharp or extra-sharp cheddar cheese, grated
1/2 lb elbow pasta, uncooked

Heat over to 375F and position an oven rack in the upper third of the oven.  Use 1 tbsp of butter to butter a 9-inch round baking pan.

In a blender, puree cottage cheese, milk, mustard, cayenne, nutmeg and salt and pepper together.  Reserve 1/4 cup grated cheese for topping.  In a large bowl, combine the rest of the cheese, milk mixture and uncooked pasta.  Pour into prepared pan, cover tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes.

Uncover pan, stir gently, sprinkle with reserved cheese and dot with remaining tbsp of butter.  Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes, until browned.  Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
