Butter Chicken
via Kake Ti Hatte (by way of Bharanee Rathnasabapathy)

300 gms chicken cubed into 1/2 in size pieces,
    bigger if you like them that way.
    Should be boneless, pref. chicken thighs

Marinate with:

1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tsp of ground pepper
1 tsp of garam masala
1 tsp of garlic

(30 mins to an hour).

Substitute garam masala with chilli chicken powder or tandoori chicken powder(local indian stores have them) if you want a diff. taste

 
2 large onions (red, if not yellow), finely chopped,
take 1/4 of that and grind to a fine paste along with a tbsp  of chopped cilantro,
1 long red hot pepper(safeway, coles), 1 cardamom(remove outer shell), 1 in. cinnamon
stick or a pinch or 2 of powder, 1 tsp of ginger, 1 tsp of garlic.

take 2-3 tbsp  of cashews and grind them to a fine paste along with 100-150ml of yogurt

(substitute yogurt with heavy cream if you like)

saute the chickens in 3 tbsp  of butter until they turn golden brown. alternatively,

grill them if you want (tastier).

in a separate pan, saute onions in oil (use lighter oils such as vegetable, sunflower or canola, if not use olive) until they're deep brown (not burnt). Add the ground paste above and keep stirring until you lose the fresh smell. You can see the oil separate, good sign of job well done so far.

add 1.5 cans of crushed italian tomatoes and cook for about 5 mins until everything comes together.

add chicken and cook for another, 3-4 mins and add salt to taste add the yogurt, cashew mix and stir for 2mins

serve hot with rice or naan, use unsalted butter. 

add a dollop of butter and some chopped cilantro on the top as garnish.

adding 1tbsp chopped fenugreek leaves along with tomatoes will give the characteristic taste, but newbies dont like it.

To increase zing, add 2-3 tsp of chilli/tandoori chicken masala/garam masala powder to the ground paste.
