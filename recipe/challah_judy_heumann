2 tbsp yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1/3 cup oil
1/3 cup honey (slightly less for a less honey-ey taste)
1 cup warm water
3 eggs
1 tbsp salt
6-7 cups flour
2 tbsp brandy (optional)
1 beaten egg (but you won't need the whole thing)
poppy or sesame seeds

Put yeast in a glass container with the 1/2 cup of warm water.  Let rise in a warm place until about doubled and bubbly.

Mix oil, honey, eggs, salt, 1 cup warm water and brandy in a bowl.  Put half in a food processor.

Process with about half of the flour, until it feels right - not too sticky and not too stiff.  Set aside on a floured surface.

Put the other half of the wet mixture into the food processor, and add flour and mix.

When the consistency is good, take the second half out of the food processor and knead together with the first.

Shape into a ball and put into an oiled bowl, turn the ball to cover with oil.

Let rise in a warm oven for about 1 hour, covered, until doubled in bulk (or, put in a plastic bag and place in the microwave for an hour).

Separate into 3 or 4 pieces depending upon how many loaves you want (makes four smallish loaves).

Divide each part into 4 sections and roll into ropes, braid each (knead individual pieces if they have hard bits on them so that they roll more easily).

Put on greased baking sheets.

Brush with a bit of beaten egg (be sure to get it into the cracks, they'll expand) and sprinkle on seeds.

Let rise until doubled (30 to 45 minutes, or more) (optionally by putting in a cold oven above a pan of boiling water).

(Ten minutes before you think it'll be done, take it out and put it on the counter while the oven heats up. Poke with a toothpick in a discreet location to test.)

Bake at 350 for 20-30 minutes.  Golden brown when done.
