1 cup whole milk
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon plus a pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 heads Roasted Garlic

Gently heat milk in a small saucepan, just until barely simmering. Remove and keep covered.

In a separate saucepan, melt butter. When foam subsides, add flour and stir until smooth.

Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring. Do not allow flour to color.

Gradually add the warm milk, whisking to combine.

Add the salt and cayenne and increase the heat to medium.

Cook the mixture, whisking continuously, until the sauce comes to a boil and is thickened.

Remove from heat and add 10 of the roasted garlic cloves.  Using a potato masher, mash the garlic sauce until desired chunkiness is achieved.

Transfer to a small bowl and cool slightly, placing a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface.
