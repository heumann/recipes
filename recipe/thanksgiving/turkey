Turkey
via Judy Heumann

As far as turkey goes,  this is not rocket science.  All I do is:

* buy a turkey

* clean it out with water and salt and pepper the outside,

* stuff if (do you want a stuffing recipe?  That I have.),

* put it in a brown paper bag breast side down and close up the bag (staples work)

* and cook it according to how many pounds it is.  I did check out this link
  this year if you want more information, but don't let all of the instructions
  get in the way.

Here is a site with a time chart for cooking---depends if it is stuffed or not stuffed.

Don't let the stuff about using a cooking thermometer or other weird stuff
bother you.  Really--if it is not frozen, the time chart will suffice.  If you
cook it a little longer than it says to be sure it is done---no problem.
Wiggle the leg to see if it wiggles freely and that is a way to tell as well.
I wouldn't buy a huge one for your first go around.  Stay well under 20 pounds.
