Fruit Crisp
by Josh Heumann (not Judy Heumann)

1 cup flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon

Fill 9" pan with fruit of choice to within 1/2 inch of the top.  Mix all ingredients together, spread over the fruit.  Bake at 350F for 30 minutes, or until the top is slightly brown and the fruit is bubbling (depending on the fruit).
