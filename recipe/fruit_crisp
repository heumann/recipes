Fruit Crisp
via Judy Heumann, who swears that the one that Josh makes is a better recipe somehow

1 cup flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon

Fill 9" pan with fruit of choice to within 1/2 inch of the top.  Mix all ingredients together, spread over the fruit.  Bake at 350F for 30 minutes, or until the top is slightly brown and the fruit is bubbling (depending on the fruit).
