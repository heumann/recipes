1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 ounces)
1 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips (2 cups)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Line an 8x8 pan with parchment paper.

On a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips, stirring a little.  

As soon as the chocolate has melted, turn the heat down and add sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract.  

Stir to combine and remove from heat.

Pour into the prepared pan and spread out with a rubber spatula.

Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Remove from pan and cut into small pieces for serving. Store in the fridge.
