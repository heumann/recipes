via Shara Lambeth (http://www.sharalambethdesigns.com/2010/03/gluten-free-ginger-cake-with-caramel.html)
Cake:
3/4 cup (165g) firmly packed brown sugar
3/4 cup (110g) Gluten Free plain flour
1/2 cup (75g) Gluten Free self-raising flour (or 1/2 cup plain flour + 1/2 tsp baking powder + a pinch of salt)
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
125g butter, softened
2 eggs
2/3 cup (160ml) buttermilk

Caramel Icing:
60g butter
1/2 cup (110g) firmly packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons milk
3/4 cup (120g) Icing sugar

Cake:

1. Preheat your oven to 170C (150C fan forced oven). Grease a deep 20cm ring pan or bundt tin.

2. Sift sugar, flours, bicarb, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg into a medium bowl.
Add butter, eggs and buttermilk. Beat with an electric mixer on low until all
ingredients are combined. Increase the speed to medium and beat for another 2
minutes or until the mixture is smooth and paler in colour.

3. Pour mixture into prepared tin, bake for about 35 minutes. You'll know it's
cooked if you poke a skewer into it and it comes out clean. Stand your cake in
the pan for about 10 minutes before turning out, and let it rest on a wire
cooling rack. Note: If you have used a ring pan, let you cake rest with the
topside up. If you have used a bunt tin, let your cake rest topside down :-)

Icing:

Gently heat butter, sugar and milk in a small saucepan over a medium heat,
stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Bring to the boil them simmer, stirring
for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sifted icing sugar. Drizzle warm
icing over cake.
