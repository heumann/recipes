Double Chocolate Espresso Cookies
Wild Oats

10oz (~285g) semisweet chocolate, chopped (or chips)
2 tbsp espresso beans, finely ground (or coffee)
2 cups unbleached flour
1/2 cup dutch processed unsweetened cocoa
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
10 tbsp (300g) unsalted butter, softened (or 250g if you want dough that's easier to deal with cold, fluffier cookies and, well, less butter)
1 cup light brown sugar, packed
2/3 cup sucrose
3 tsp vanilla
4 large eggs
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (or chocolate covered espresso beans)
1 cup walnuts, chopped (optional)

Preheat oven to 350F.

In a double boiler, melt the chocolate with espresso.  Set aside.

Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt.  Set aside.

In a large bowl beat butter, brown sugar, sucrose and vanilla with a mixer until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Mix in melted chocolate.

Mix in dry ingredients, until just incorporated.

Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.

Put on a greased (or lined with parchment paper) cookie sheet, about 1 1/2 inches between.  Bake for 10-12 mintues.
