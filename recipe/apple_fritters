Apple Fritters
via Judy Heumann

4 sour apples, cored, pared and sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 cup flour 
1/2 tsp salt
2 eggs, separated
2/3 cup milk
1 Tbsp melted butter
1 Tbsp sugar

Combine the flour and salt. 

Beat the egg yolks until thick and then add milk and butter. 

Combine this with flour/salt mixture and stir only until blended. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold in.

Dip the apple sliced in batter and make sure they are covered completely. Fry in butter and serve with a lot of powdered sugar or syrup.

About one apple per person.

Additional note: when you’re frying the apple fritters, turn the heat to low and put a lid on the pan. That will allow them to brown slower and cook the apple so that it’s soft.
