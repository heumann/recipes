cream of tomato soup

half an onion, finely chopped
3 celery stalks (and leaves), finely chopped
butter or oil
4 cloves garlic (I used roasted garlic and it's oil)
6 tomatoes (I used thawed frozen tomatoes, throw out skins, keep the juices)
salt
pepper
paprika
a little sugar
bay leaf
about a half cup of milk

in a soup pot and on low/medium heat, melt a little bit of butter or oil and cook onion, celery, garlic and salt until translucent (about 10 mins), make sure mixture stays wet, if it's starting to overcook and turn brown, throw in some of the tomato juices from the thawing.

add the tomato and a bay leaf, turn up heat to medium, cover and let cook for 15 mins - remove the bay leaf.

season with salt, pepper, sugar and paprika - simmer for another 10 mins or until all the vegetables are very soft.

remove from heat and blend using an immersion blender, making sure to get all the chunks out.

Add the milk and blend some more.

If needed, add back to stove top and reheat.  Serves 2-3 people.

(cobbled together from different sources, quantities and ingredients can be fudged a bit)
