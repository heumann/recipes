French Chicken in a Pot (aka Dutch Oven)

Prep time:  10 mins Cook time:  110 mins Total time:  2 hours
Serves: 4
 
Ingredients:

1 whole roasting chicken (4½ to 5 pounds), giblets removed, wings tucked in
2 teaspoons good salt
¼ teaspoon ground black or white pepper
2 tablespoons butter, coconut oil, ghee, palm oil, lard, chicken fat or duck fat
1 small onion , rough chopped (about ½ cup)
1 small stalk celery , rough chopped (about ¼ cup)
6 medium garlic cloves, skin removed
1 bay leaf
1 medium sprig fresh rosemary (optional)
½ – 1 teaspoon juice from 1 lemon

Instructions:

Part 1:
- Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 250 degrees.
- Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper (this is a very essential step for proper browning).
- Heat fat of choice in large Dutch oven over medium heat until just smoking.
- Add chicken breast-side down; scatter onion, celery, garlic, bay leaf, and rosemary around chicken.
- Cook until breast is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
- Using a wooden spoon inserted into cavity of bird, flip chicken breast-side up and cook until chicken and vegetables are well browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
- Remove Dutch oven from heat; place large sheet of foil over pot and cover tightly with lid.
- Transfer pot to oven and cook until instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees when inserted in thickest part of breast and 175 degrees in thickest part of thigh, 80 to 110 minutes.

Part 2:
- Transfer chicken to carving board, tent with foil, and rest 20 minutes.
- (optional) Meanwhile, strain chicken juices from pot through fine-mesh strainer into fat separator, pressing on solids to extract liquid; discard solids (you should have about ¾ cup juices). Allow liquid to settle 5 minutes, then pour into saucepan and set over low heat.
Carve chicken, adding any accumulated juices to saucepan.
Stir lemon juice into jus to taste. Serve chicken, passing jus at table.
