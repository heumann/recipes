Tapioca Pudding
Tammy Lindel

3 tbsp tapioca (the older the tapioca, the longer it should soak in water beforehand)
3 tbsp sugar
1 egg yolk
3 tbsp sugar
2 cups milk
1 egg white
3/4 tsp vanilla
1/8 tsp salt

Mix tapioca, salt, 3 tbsp sugar, milk and egg yolk in a pan.  Let stand five minutes.  Beat egg white until foamy, and gradually add 3 tbsp sugar, beating to form soft peaks.  Set aside.  Cook tapioca mixture over medium heat to a full boil, stirring constantly (6-8 minutes, or longer).  Gradually add egg white to tapioca, stir in vanilla.

If doubling:

6 tbsp (or 3/8 cup) tapioca
6 tbsp (or 3/8 cup) sugar
2 egg yolks
6 tbsp (or 3/8 cup) sugar
4 cups milk
2 egg whites
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
