Pizza Tonight!
Judy Heumann

1 tbsp yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1 tsp sugar

2 cups flour
1 tsp salt
more water

Optional: 1 tsp sugar extra

Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup of warm water.

Sprinkle sugar on top.

Let bubble up in a warm place.

In a food processor, mix flour and salt [and optional extra sugar].

Add yeast, and then enough water to make a soft dough.

Continue to process for a few minutes.

Grease a bowl, turn dough out onto a floured surface and shape into a smooth ball.

Put into bowl and turn so both sides are greased.

Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled (45 - 60 minutes).

Press into pizza pan and bake at 350F until lightly browned.

Top with:

sauce
veggies
mozzarella cheese
