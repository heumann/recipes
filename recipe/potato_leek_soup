via http://allrecipes.com.au/recipe/9841/potato-and-leek-soup.aspx

1 large brown onion diced
4 celery sticks sliced
6 large potatoes chopped roughly
2 leeks sliced
200ml un-thickened cream (or milk + butter)
2 litres chicken stock
2 tablespoons of parsley chopped
garlic
salt to taste

Cook the onions, salted, in a pot on low heat until it is clear and soft.
 
Add the leek and cook stirring for ten minutes or until also soft (be careful not to get too much brown stuff on bottom of pot).

Add the potato and celery and cook for a further 3 minutes.

Add the stock and bring to the boil, then turn heat down and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until potato is very soft but not flakey.

Blend together and slowly add cream as you blend (you can add more cream if you like).

Stir through salt to taste, and the parsley to serve (and dont forget some black pepper).

Serve with hot dark brown bread
