Hazelnut Slice
via Anna O'Sullivan

1 packet hazelnuts, toasted 15 minutes at 150C
1 packet milk coffee biscuits, crushed

Bring to the boil and cook for 7 minutes:

6oz butter
2tblsp golden syrup
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 can condensed milk

Mix altogether and place in slice tin.

Melt 4oz chocolate and 1 oz  copha  and spread on top.

That is the recipe that I was given, however I usually double the recipe as 1/2 tin of condensed milk is useless…..  but I only use 10oz butter 
I roughly peel the nuts when they are cool & chop roughly

And I usually melt more chocolate for the top….
