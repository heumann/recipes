Shortcake
via David Sweet

10 oz flour
5 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 stick cold butter, cut into pieces
1 egg lightly beaten
1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp half-and-half or whole milk
1 egg white lightly beaten

Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 425F.

In a food processor, pulse the flour, 3 tbsp of sugar, baking powder, and salt to combine.  Scatter the butter pieces over and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal, about 15 one-second pulses.

Transfer to a medium bowl. 

Mix the beaten egg with the half-and-half, and pour into flour mixture.  Combine with a spatula until large clumps form.  Turn the mixture out onto a floured board and knead until it comes together.

Use your fingertips to pat the dough into a 9"-6" rectangle about 3/4" thick, being careful not to overwork the dough.  

Flour a 2 3/4" biscuit cutter and cut out 6 dough rounds.  Place on a baking sheet about 1" apart, brush the tops with the egg white, and sprinkle with remaining sugar. (Rounds can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 hours at this stage.)

Bake until the shortcakes are golden brown, 12-14 minutes.  Place the baking sheet on a wire rack to cool until warm.
