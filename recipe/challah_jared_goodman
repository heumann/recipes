1 tsp sugar
1/2 cup warm water
1 pkg yeast
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup warm water
1/4 cup sugar
2 tsp salt
2 eggs, plus one egg beaten with 1 tsp water
3 1/2 to 4 cups flour
poppy or sesame seeds (optional)

Dissolve sugar in 1/2 cup warm water in a large mixing bowl which has first been rinsed with hot water.  Sprinkle yeast on top and let stand for 10 minutes.  Stir to dissolve.

Combine oil, warm water, sugar, salt, 2 eggs, and half of the flour.  Beat well.  Stir in remaining flour (dough should be sticky).

Cover dough and let rest for 10 minutes.

Turn out onto a floured board and knead for 10 minutes, adding flour as needed.

Round up in a greased bowl.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Punch down, cover and let rise again until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Divide dough into 3 equal parts.  Shape into strands.  Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and braid loosely.  Fasten ends securely.  Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled.

Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with seeds.  Bake at 400F for 30 minutes, until golden brown.
