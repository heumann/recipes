Prepare enough dough for two pie crusts that will make up the bottom and top of the pie.

Line a 9-inch pie pan with 1 pie dough.

Prepare by picking over and hulling 4 cups fresh berries

Combine: 
2/3 to 1 cup or more sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

If the fruit is very juicy and ripe, add 2 teaspoons quick-cooking tapioca

Sprinkle the flour mixture over the berries and stir gently until well blended. Let stand for 15 minutes. 

Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C).

Turn the fruit into the pie shell. Dot with 1 to 2 tablespoons butter  

Cover the pie with a well-pricked top or with a lattice. Bake the pie at 450°F (230°C) for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350°F (175°C) and bake 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown.
