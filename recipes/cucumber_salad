Cucumber Salad
via Amy

2 cucumbers
1 red onion
1/2 c red wine vinegar
1 tbsp sugar
dijon mustard
salt and pepper to taste
dill
cherry tomatoes (halved)
kalamata olives

Thickly slice cucumbers and onions - put in a large bowl

In a separate bowl whisk mustard, sugar, vinegar, salt pepper and dill - then pour onto cukes/onions

Stir and refrigerate - the longer refrigerated for, the more pickled the cukes get, yum!
