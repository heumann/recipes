5 egg yolks
1 cup sugar
4 lemons, zested and juiced
1 stick (~113 grams) butter, cut into pats and chilled

Add enough water to a medium saucepan to come about 1-inch up the side.

Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

Meanwhile, combine egg yolks and sugar in a medium size metal bowl and whisk until smooth, about 1 minute.

Measure citrus juice and if needed, add enough cold water to reach 1/3 cup.

Add juice and zest to egg mixture and whisk smooth.

Once water reaches a simmer, reduce heat to low and place bowl on top of saucepan.

(Bowl should be large enough to fit on top of saucepan without touching the water.)

Whisk until thickened, approximately 8 minutes, or until mixture is light yellow and coats the back of a spoon.

Remove promptly from heat and stir in butter a piece at a time, allowing each addition to melt before adding the next.

Remove to a clean container and cover by laying a layer of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the curd.

Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
