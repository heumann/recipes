Quiche
via Allison Sheehan

250-300g flour
125-250g butter, softened
salt
1 leek, chopped and rinsed
cheese (fresh goat cheese aka chevre, or swiss/jarlsberg)
3-4 eggs
sour cream or heavy cram (175ml)

Mix flour and salt.  Push butter into flour using fingers.  Once thoroughly
incorporated, add a little warm water and form a ball.  Putt the dough into the
fridge for between 15 and 45 minutes.

Saute the leeks in butter.

Beat the eggs and cream (and any spices you'd like, such as cumin, pepper, etc).

Pre-heat the oven to 400F.

Roll out dough, folding and rolling again several times until it's about 1/4 -
1/8" thick, and place in a thin metal pie dish (or a glass one).

Put the dough in oven until it inflates a bit.

Remove and add leeks, cheese, and then egg mixture.

Put back in the oven until done!
