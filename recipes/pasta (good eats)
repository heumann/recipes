Pasta (good eats)
via https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/ravioli-recipe-1940188

3 cups all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt

In a measuring cup mix the eggs, water and oil and salt. 

On a clean surface make a well with the flour. 

Pour the wet mixture slowly into the flour and mix with your 2 fingers until all of the wet is incorporated. 

Do not force the dough to take all of the flour. If you are going to use a pasta machine to roll out the dough you may at this point form the dough into a disk and cover with plastic wrap. 

Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to rest.

Cut into quarters.  For each one:

Feed the dough through the pasta machine on its biggest opening.  Fold into thirds, turn 90 degrees, and send it through.  Do the folding and sending through again for a total of three runs on the largest opening, then start re-feeding it through on smaller openings until you get the thickness you want.
