Crisp Meringues
via http://www.thekitchn.com/easy-dessert-recipe-crisp-meri-146685

4 egg whites from large eggs 
1 cup white sugar
pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla

Heat the oven to 250Â°F. Line two large baking sheets with Silpats or parchment paper.

Put the egg whites, salt, and vanilla into the bowl of a stand mixer (whisk attachment). Start the mixer on low speed.

As the whites turn opaque start adding the sugar in small increments - just a tablespoon at a time.

Continue adding the sugar, and gradually increase the speed of the mixer. You will see the egg whites turn into an opaque foam, and then a "soft plop" stage where a drizzle of the foam holds its shape on the surface of the egg whites.

Continue beating egg whites until they form stiff peaks, where the meringue will hold almost any shape. It will form sharp, distinct points in the bowl, and it is quite stiff and glossy. It should feel smooth and silky, with no sugar grains when the mixture is rubbed between thumb and finger.

Fill a piping bag with the meringue and pipe it into the shape desired.

Bake the meringues for 75 minutes. Turn off the oven and crack it open. Let the meringues cool completely. Then remove from the oven and store in an airtight container until serving.
