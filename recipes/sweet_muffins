via http://www.food.com/recipe/best-blueberry-muffins-cooks-illustrated-318626

2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (10 ounces)
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1 large egg
1 cup granulated sugar (7 ounces)
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 1/4 cups sour cream (10 ounces)
1 1/2 cups frozen blueberries, preferably wild

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray
standard muffin tin with nonstick vegetable cooking spray.

Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl until combined. Whisk egg
in second medium bowl until well-combined and light-colored, about 20 seconds.

Add sugar and whisk vigorously until thick and homogenous, about 30 seconds;
add melted butter in 2 or 3 steps, whisking to combine after each addition. Add
sour cream in 2 steps, whisking just to combine.

Add frozen berries to dry ingredients and gently toss to combine. Add sour
cream mixture and fold with rubber spatula until batter comes together and
berries are evenly distributed, 25 to 30 seconds (small spots of flour may
remain and batter will be thick). Do not overmix.

Use ice cream scoop or large spoon to drop batter into greased muffin tin. Bake
until light golden brown and toothpick or skewer inserted into center of muffin
comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan from front to back halfway
through baking time. Invert muffins onto wire rack, stand muffins upright, and
cool 5 minutes.
