laundry detergent

Ingredients:

- Washing Soda (Arm and Hammer Brand available at most stores)
- Borax
- Bar Soap (Dr. Bronner’s, or laundry bars Zote, Fels-Naptha)

Method:

- Grate the bar soap or mix in food processor until finely ground. Use the soap of your choice. I personally use Dr. Bronner’s Pure Castille Bar Soap because of its exceptional quality, and because it is available in several different natural scents like lavender, tea tree, peppermint, almond and others.

-In a large bowl, mix 2 parts washing soda, 2 parts Borax and 1 part grated soap. (Add a few teaspoons of baking soda if desired).

-Store in closed containers and shake before each use.

-Use 1/8 to 1/4 cup per load of laundry.
