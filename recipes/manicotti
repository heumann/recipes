Judy Heumann

(Recipe is for half the package of noodles.  Double if you'd like more to freeze.)

7 manicotti tubes
15 oz ricotta cheese
1 1/2 cups grated mozzarella
1/4 cup parmesean
1 egg
1 tbsp of chopped parsley
small amounts of:
    basil
    salt
    pepper
    garlic
1/8 tsp nutmeg
1 jar spaghetti sauce

Mix ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella, half of the parmesean, egg, parsley and seasonings.  In a baking dish 9x9 (or larger), put about 1/2 cup of the sauce.  Fill tubes and lay on sauce with 1/2" - 1" between them.  Cover with sauce.  Gently add 1/2-3/4 cups of water, pouring around the tubes.  Cover with foil, bake at 350F for 35 minutes.  Top with remianing cheeses and bake uncovered for 10 more minutes.
