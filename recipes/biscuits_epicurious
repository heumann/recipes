Buttermilk Biscuits
3 cups all purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup (1 1/2sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
1 cup buttermilk

Preheat oven to 425Â°F.

Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large bowl to blend.

Using fingertips, rub 3/4 cup chilled butter into dry ingredients until mixture
resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk and stir until evenly moistened.

Using 1/4 cup dough for each biscuit, drop biscuits onto baking sheet, spacing
2 inches apart. Bake until biscuits are golden brown on top, about 15 minutes.

Cool slightly. Serve warm.
