12 servings

Ingredients

5 pounds cored whole tomatoes, fresh or frozen
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
1 head of garlic, minced
¾ teaspoon dried basil or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh
¾ teaspoon dried thyme or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh
¾ teaspoon dried oregano or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh
1¾ teaspoons salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/2 teaspoons sugar (optional)

Preparation

If using fresh tomatoes, bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Make a small X in the bottom of each tomato and plunge into the boiling water until the skins are slightly loosened, 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl of ice water for 1 minute.
Peel with a paring knife, starting at the X.

If using frozen tomatoes, run each under warm water and peel or rub the skin off. Defrost slightly in the microwave or stick the bowl of frozen tomatoes into a warm water bath. Mash the tomatoes, reserving all the juice.

Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Add onions and cook, stirring, until beginning to brown, about 10-15 minutes.
Add garlic and cook, stirring, for a few minutes.
Add the tomatoes (and juices), basil, thyme, oregano, salt, pepper and sugar.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook until thickened to desired consistency, stirring occasionally, 2 hours.
Taste and season with additional salt, pepper and/or sugar.

Notes: This garden-fresh tomato sauce is a delicious way to use summer-ripe tomatoes. Or freeze whole tomatoes and make this sauce later on in the winter. Just remove the cores and freeze them whole. Then, turn your frozen tomatoes into a garden-fresh sauce any time of the year. For pizza sauce: In Step 2, cook until thickened to about the consistency of pizza sauce, 1½ to 2 hours. Remove from the heat, transfer to a blender, add 2 tablespoons tomato paste and blend until smooth.
