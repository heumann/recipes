Oil-based sugar cookies
via Joy Of Cooking

2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon and/or 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a  medium-sized bowl, sift together flour,
baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.

In another, larger bowl, combine sugar and vegetable oil.

Add eggs and vanilla to this mixture and beat well after each addition.

Add the flour mixture all at once and beat well, but briefly. Spread in
teaspoon-sized portions on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Use a spatula dipped
in ice water to flatten dough to a maximum 1/4-inch thickness for even baking.

Or:

Shape the dough into 1/2-inch balls. Dip the balls in sugar.  Flatten as above.

Bake about 12 to 15 minutes or until browned.
