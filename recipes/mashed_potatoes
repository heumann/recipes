Some potatoes, peeled
some cream
some milk
some garlic, peeled
some butter (optional)
some salt

Put potatoes in a pot and cover with warm water.  Add enought salt to make the water somewhat like seawater.  Put over a burner turned to high.  When it boils, lower the heat to a high simmer.

Put cream, milk, garlic cloves and butter in a pan and simmer until garlic is soft.

When potatoes crumble when grabbed with a pair of tongs, drain potatoes and put back in pot.  Add milk mixture while mashing, a little at a time.  Do not add too much milk mixture.
