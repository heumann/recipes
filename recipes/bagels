Bagels
via effyoutoo

4 cups bread flour
1 TBS sugar
1 1/2 tsps salt
1 TBS vegetable oil
2 tsps quick rising (or "instant") yeast
1-1/4 C warm water

mix it all until all the flour in incorporated, it will be pretty stiff. i wish i had a stand mixer for this, my spaghetti arms were taxed. after it's mixed throw it on a lightly floured counter and knead for 10 minutes or until it's smooth and uniform. divide it into 8 equals balls, cover and let rest for 20 minutes. pre-heat your oven to 425 and get a pot of water ready. after the 20 minutes are up take each ball and roll out into a snake like shape that's just bigger than your two hands. take the snake and make it into a bagel shape. i wrapped the two ends around my hand so they met at the palm and tried my best to roll them together. after you've done that for each cover and let rest another 20 minutes. turn on the water and get it to a boil. put in the boiling water as many bagels as will fit without being crowded (i could get 3 in at a time) and boil for a minute. after a minute turn them over and boil that side for a minute. take them out and let they dry for a minute (i put them on a wire rack with paper towels under it). at this point if you're putting any seeds or spice on them do it now. put the bagels on a lightly greased baking pan and bake at 425 for 10 minutes then turn them over and bake another 10 minutes. let them cool for 20 minutes and enjoy.
