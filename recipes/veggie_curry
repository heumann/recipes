Veggie Curry
by Amy Zirkle

1 tbsp ghee
small chunk of ginger, thinly chopped
3-4 cloves of garlic, thinly chopped
2 onions, chopped
1 carrot, sliced
1 potato, cubed
8-12 mushrooms, sliced
red capsicum, chopped

2-3 spoonful red curry paste
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp curry powder
1/2 tsp coriander
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

2 cans of coconut milk

1/2 tsp garam masala
salt to taste

1. Mix curry paste, and seasonings in a bowl with a small bit of water (or
coconut milk), enough to make a liquidy paste.  Set aside.

2. Over medium heat melt ghee, then saute garlic and ginger for ~ 2 mins.
Then add and saute the onions until a bit golden ~ 8 mins?

3. Plop the seasoning paste from step 1 into the hot pan and stir to
thoroughly combine, cook for ~ 2 mins.

4. Stir in the coconut milk.  Once it starts to bubble add the potatoes and
carrots.  Cook for 15 mins or until veggies start to soften a little.

5. Add the mushrooms and capsicum, and cook for another 10 mins, or until
the veggies are as soft as you want them.

6. Add some salt and the garam masala to taste and cook for a few minutes,
then serve with rice.
