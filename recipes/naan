Naan
via Allison Sheehan

200g flour
1 tbs olive oil
2 pinches baking powder
3 pinches sugar
3 pinches salt
125ml yogurt
50ml warm water

Blend and smush between your thumb and pointer fingers the flour, oil, baking
powder, sugar and salt.

Add the yogurt while keeping blending and smushing with your fingers until
combined.

Add the warm water and combine until you can ball the mixture.

Use a little bit of oil to grease the ball and the countertop.

Throw the ball down hard on the table top.  do this many many many times until
you no longer see cracks in the dough, the ball is a more uniform consistency
and becomes soft and sticky.

Let rest at room temp for 3-4 hours

Preheat oven to 300 C

Split dough in to four rounds (8 if you're doubling the recipe etc.) sprinkle
flour on balls and roll with a rolling pin on a floured surface (thinner naans
are better) place naans on a baking tray and bake for 5 minutes.

You could also cook them one by one in a cast iron skillet on the stove top.
They seem to fluff up rather nicely.  Probably have to use a pretty high heat
on a gas stove for this to work.

Makes 4 naans.
