Challah
Sarah Rosen

1 tbsp yeast
1/2 cup + 2 tbsp water
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tbsp brandy
2 eggs
2 tbsl honey
1 cup + 1 tbsp [optional: + 1 tsp ] unbleached flour
1 cup + 7/8 cup [optional: + 1 tsp ] bread flour
3/4 tsp salt (+more?)
2 tbsp oil

In a 2c measuring cup, put 2 tbsp water, honey, brandy, 1 whole egg and 1 egg white.  Set aside.

In a small measuring cup, put oil and set aside.

In a measuring cup put 1/2 cup water, heat in microwave for 20 seconds.  Mix in sugar, slowly mix in yeast until mixed.  Put yeast in microwave (off) for five minutes, until doubled.

Add yeast to egg mixture and mix the two.

In a food processor, put combined flours and salt, pulse.  Drizzle in oil while processor is on.  Turn on processor, and add yeast/egg mixture and mix until a ball forms.  Check texture and moisture (should be slightly tacky and soft).  Adjust with all-purpose flour (1tbsp) or water (1 tbsp) as needed.

Remove to a lightly floured surface, knead until dough doesn't stick to itself (about 15 to 20 kneads).

Put dough in a floured bag, let sit in microwave for 20 minutes, until a deep poke with two fingers, imprint stays.

Gently knead/punch dough down about 10 times, shape into a ball and let sit covered for 10 minutes with plastic.  Take a little bit and set aside to burn.

Separate dough into 4 equal pieces, roll into longs.

Using the outside edge of your hand, crease down the middle, and pinch back together.  Crease again, turn so crease is facing away and pinch together using heel of your hand.

Roll into long again, and roll briefly on a floured towel.  Braid, twist ends, fold under.

Roll braided whole to round.  Put on a tray, cover with plastic and a towel.  Let rise in a warm place for 25 minutes.  Mix yolk with 1/2 tbsp water, brush on.  Preheat oven to 350F, bake for 15 minutes.  Turn, bake for 10 minutes.  Temp of challah should be 200F when measured with a probe.
