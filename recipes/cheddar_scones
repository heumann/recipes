Cheddar Scones
from Adam DuVander

1 3/4 cups unbleached flour
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp dry mustard (we used wet mustard and subtracted liquid)
1/4 tsp salt
a dash of cayenne pepper
3 Tablespoons butter
1 cup grated cheese
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup milk

* Preheat over to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter a baking sheet.

* In a large bowl, thoroughly combine flours, mustard, salt, and pepper

* Mix in bits of butter until it resembles coarse crumbs

* Stir in all but 2 Tablespoons of the grated cheese

* Mix the egg with the milk and stir in until just evenly moistened

* Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times. Pat into 1/2 inch thick circle and cut it into 8 pizza-like slices.

* Brush the tops with some milk, then sprinkle on the rest of the cheese.

* Bake for 17 minutes
