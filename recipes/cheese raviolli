via https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/tortellini-recipe-2011857

1/2 cup ricotta cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
2 tablespoons chopped spinach or fresh parsley
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg

Fresh pasta, recipe follows
Egg wash: 1 egg mixed with 1/2 teaspoon water

For the optional browned butter for 10 raviolis:
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon sliced sage

In a bowl combine all ingredients, except for the pasta and egg wash.

After you have rolled the pasta out into sheets, cut the sheet into an even amount of squares. Using a teaspoon fill the center of half with the filling. Brush around the filling with the egg wash and place the remaining squares on top. Press down around the seal to push out any air bubbles.

In half a gallon of rapidly boiling salted water add the ravioli in batches. Remove to a strainer.

Optional:

In a separate pan over medium heat place the butter until it just starts to brown. Toss in 10 ravioli until coated. Sprinkle in the sage and toss again to evenly distribute.
