via http://bushel-and-a-peck.weebly.com/1/post/2014/04/flour-free-brownie-cookies.html

1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 tablespoon corn starch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cocoa powder
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup walnuts (optional)


Method:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line a cookie sheet with parchment, & set aside.

In a small bowl mix together the baking soda, cornstarch, salt, and cocoa.

Cream together the butter and sugars. Add the egg and vanilla and mix until combined.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined (it can
take a few minutes to work it all together).

Stir in the chocolate chips (and nuts if you're using 'em).

Using a one-tablespoon scoop, or a regular tablespoon, scoop cookies out into baking sheet, 3 inches apart.

Bake in pre-heated oven for 7 minutes. They will look a touch under done, but that's perfect, they will continue to cook a little as they cool.
