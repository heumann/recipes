2-1/4 cup flour
1 tsp baking soda
1-1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (or nutmeg)
1-1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp finely ground black pepper (or not, it might have been unnecessary)
1/4 tsp salt
12 tbsp (170g) unsalted butter, softened but still cool
1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup granulated sugar, plus 1/2 cup for rolling
1 large egg yolk
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup molasses (possibly less)

Preheat oven to 375F and line a large baking sheet with parchment.

In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, spices, pepper and salt together.

Either by hand or with electric mixer, beat the butter with brown sugar and 1/3
cup granulated sugar at medium high speed until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Reduce speed to medium low and add yolk and vanilla. Increase speed
and beat until incorporated, about 20 seconds. Reduce speed and add molasses.
Beat until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds, scraping the bottom and sides
once with a rubber spatula.

Reduce speed to lowest setting and slowly add flour mixture and beat until just
incorporated, scraping the bowl once. Give the dough a final stir by hand to
ensure no flour pockets are at the bottom (dough will be soft).

Place 1/2 cup sugar in a shallow bowl for rolling. Fill a small bowl with cold
tap water. Dip hands in water and roll heaping tablespoon of dough into scant
ball. Drop ball in sugar and roll to coat.


Set on prepared baking sheet at least 2 inches apart. Bake about 11 minutes
(cookies will "crack", edges are puffy and inside of cracks look raw). Do not
over bake.

Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes and transfer to a wire rack to continue
cooling. Serve when cooled to room temperature.
