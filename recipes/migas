olive oil
cumin seeds
couple sliced jalapenos
poblano, chopped
lots of chopped garlic
bit of onion, chopped
some carrot, shredded
eggs
cheese
tortilla chips
tomato

Get a pan really hot, add olive oil (or peanut oil if you want to die young).  In order and one at a time add and let cook until dark:

cumin seeds
sliced jalapenos
chopped poblano
chopped garlic
chopped onion
shredded carrot

When the carrot's mostly cooked, turn the heat way down and add some eggs; no need to beat them first.

Mix things up until the eggs are half cooked, then pile on some shredded cheese and some crushed tortilla chips.

Put some chopped tomato on top and cover it.

At this point you want the cheese to melt, the tortilla chips to steam a little, and the eggs to finish cooking.  Then mix it up and you're done.
