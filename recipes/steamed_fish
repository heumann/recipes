Steamed Fish
via Leon Lee

2 fillets of fish (ie, Basa)
green onions
ginger
pepper
vegetable oil
soy sauce

cut green onions into 1.5" strips, and cut strips lengthwise several times.

cut ginger thinly, and cut into small 1.5"-long thin stalks.

Put fish on a deepish plate, steam in a pan over a couple of chopsticks (or a steamer).

Check fish after five minutes after steam starts.  When it's done, take plate out of pan (do not drain) and sprinkle with pepper and soy sauce, then add green onions and ginger.

Heat oil in a separate pan and pour over fish.

Serve with white rice.
