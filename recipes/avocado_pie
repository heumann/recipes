4 avocados
1/2 cup lemon juice (to taste)
dash of salt
1 can sweetened condensed milk
20 graham cracker rectangles
6 tbsp melted butter
2 tbsp syrup

Crush graham crackers in a food processor, and put in pie pans. Combine butter
and syrup and drizzle over crumbs.  Press into dishes with a spoon and bake at
350F for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.

In mixer, bead avocado, lemon juice, salt and milk until very smooth.  Pour
