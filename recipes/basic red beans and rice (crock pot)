4-6 cups cooked kidney beans (could use other beans too)
1 cup veggie broth
1 cup tomato sauce (or 1 tbsp tomato paste)

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 medium onions, finely diced
4 large garlic cloves, minced
2 celery stalks, minced (use the celery leaves too!)
1 green pepper, finely diced (optional)
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp smoked salt/kosher salt
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp thyme
3 tbsp honey
A few dashes hot sauce (such as aardvark)
4 cups hot cooked rice (from 1 cup raw rice)

Place beans, vegetable broth, tomato sauce in the crock pot on high setting.

In a cast iron skillet, heat vegetable oil on medium heat.  Sautee onions, garlic, green pepper, celery, and a dash of salt until very soft and aromatic (10-15 minutes).

Stir cooked vegetable mixture in to the crock pot, adding chili powder, smoked paprika, smoked salt, oregano, thyme, honey and hot sauce.

Occasional stirring and adjusting spice levels while cooking, leaving crock pot setting on high for at least 4 hours, after 4 hours reduce heat to low.
