Ingredients:

20-25 frozen tomatoes, (defrosted in warm oven, remove skins, keep juice)
3 serrano chiles, remove seeds
1 tsp cumin seed
6 (or more) cloves garlic diced
1 onion diced
Salt
Canola, vegetable or avocado oil (anything tasteless)

In a large soup pot bring the tomatoes (with juice), a bit of salt, cumin seeds and two chillies to slow, roiling boil on medium heat.

Cook until the chiles have softened and turned a muted green color, and the moisture has reduced by half.  Roughly 30-45 minutes.

Remove from heat and blend using an immersion blender until all the chunks, skins and seeds are liquified.

Chop the last chili, garlic, and onion, and toss into a food processor (with some of your reserved tomato water) until well blended

Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a skillet/sauce pan over medium-high heat.

Saute your chili/garlic/onions, and salt, until soft and translucent but not caramelised.  About 15-20 minutes.

Add your blended tomato/chili mixture to the saucepan, cook on med at a low boil for 10-15 minutes or until the sauce has turned a deep red color.

You may need to use the immersion blender again to get out the lumps.
